		This is the mailbox right in front of my house. It\'s a very
		convenient test, isn\'t it\?
		\n\n
		This is the house I grew up in. Yup, I\'m a native Austinite,
		born and raised. My parents moved out the nineties, and I moved
		in several years later.
		</string>
	<string name="story_i_luv_video">
		You\'re in the parking lot of the main reason why Netflix and
		Redbox are only used by new-comers to Austin.  Step inside this
		video store and look.  Go up the stairs, wander.  Find the rooms
		full of foreign videos.  Notice the walls of movies organized by
		director.
		\n\n
		Now talk to someone who works there. You\'ll discover that each
		and every employee not only loves movies, but is extremely knowledgeable.
		Famous film directors come here to learn!
		\n\n
		And if they don\'t have a movie that you want, fill out a listing
		and they\'ll probably get it in a few weeks.
		\n\n
		A true Austin gem. There is a sister store at 2915 Guadalupe St.,
		78705. As if that isn\'t enough, there is a competing chain, Vulcan
		Video, which is almost as good (two locations: one in South Austin on
		Elizabeth and North Austin on 53rd St.).
		</string>
	<string name="story_washington">
		Look at the statue of George Washington (you need to look at it while facing
		the Southwest), the father of our country.
		It appears he\'s got a good handle on things, eh\?
		\n\n
		The story as was told to me:\n
		\tLike many things at the University of Texas, no expense was spared
		when constructing the South Mall (sometimes called the Six Pack).
		They even hired famous sculptor Pompeo Coppini to make larger-than-life
		likenesses of the famous (some are now infamous) men all about the area.
		\n\n
		But there was some dispute between the perfectionist Coppini and the
		bigwigs at UT (some things never change!), causing Coppini to quit before
		finishing the final statue: our first president of the United States of
		America.
		\n\n
		But that patriotic group of do-gooders, the Daughters of the American
		Revolution contacted Coppini and begged him to finish the statue. He
		thought, \"You\'re all a bunch of sweet ol\' ladies, I\'ll do it for you.\"
		\n\n
		But just as he was nearing completion of the statue of George,
		Coppini discovered that the \"sweet ol\' ladies\" planned to give the
		statue directly to the University of Texas.
		\n\n
		Incensed, he altered the sculpture to the amazingly humorous thing
		you are now looking at.
		\n\n
		Oh yeah, you don\'t believe me? Go ahead, read the inscription. I\'ll
		wait.
		\n\n
		So there!

	<string name="story_littlefield">
		Look east, across the street. That\'s the Littlefield building at
		106 E. 6th St. (the main entrance is on 6th). It\'s a nice old building
		with more than a century of use to its credit.
		\n\n
		Say, have you seen the movie, \"Being John Malkovich\"\? Hmmm, if you
		haven\'t, then this won\'t be very impressive.
		\n\n
		Now count the floors of the Littlefield building, starting with 1 as
		the ground floor. Notice that gap there, between the seventh and eighth
		floors\? Interesting....
		\n\n
		I used to work there, on the eighth floor. And I wondered why the stairs
		between seven and eight had and extra zag. Late one night a security guard
		(I was the only late-night guy there, so I got to know the security people
		pretty well) showed me: the half-sized door in the stairwell I never used
		that led to the SEVENTH AND A HALF FLOOR!
		\n\n
		Now take a few steps to your left, so you can see the north side of
		the Littlefield building. See! Those are the tiny half-sized windows
		of the seventh and a half floor. Wow! Who\'d\'ve thunk it\?
		\n\n
		It took me six months to find out why. Email me if you just
		<b>gotta</b> know; it\'s a long story and not very funny.
		\n\n
		And to answer your other question, they just use the space for
		storage\u2014mostly
		desks and chairs.
